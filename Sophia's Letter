Dear Sophia,

About your second letter â€” the satellite-laser-pointer proposal has officially been reviewed by the Elf Ethics Committee.

The verdict: permanently denied.  
Apparently, initiating a school science fair arms race is frowned upon in *every* jurisdiction, including space.

Please stick to vinegar and baking soda next time.

Love,  
Santa ðŸŽ…
