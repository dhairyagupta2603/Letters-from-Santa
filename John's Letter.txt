Dear John,

Yes, I got your follow-up — and no, even if it’s “for educational purposes,” a flamethrower is still off the table.

The elves reviewed your snow-clearing PowerPoint. They were impressed… but also slightly terrified.

Maybe try a heated shovel this year?

Stay jolly (and safe),  
— Santa 🎅
